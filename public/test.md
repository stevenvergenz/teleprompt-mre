Viola!

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the viccisitudes of fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished! However, this valorous
visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and vows to vanquish the venal and virulent vermin, vanguarding vice
and vouchsafing the violent and voracious violation of volition!

The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta, held as votive not in vain, for the ... of such shall one day vindicate
the vigilant and the virtuous.

Clearly this visisois of verbiage veers most verbose! So let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet
you, and you may call me V.
